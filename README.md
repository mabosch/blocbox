# blocbox

Blocbox is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others.

For this project I have worked on every step of teh creative process, from creating stories and personas to the final code (HTML, CSS and JS). I have generated low fidelity wirefrmaes using myBalsamiq, tested their usability and flows via UserTesting and then created the final high-fidelity mockup. I have also created a clickable prototype using InVision (https://invis.io/QT9C63LU2) and tested it again to saw if it was working or not.<br>
Finally, once the design was tested and accepted, I did the homepage and the dashboard using Html, Css and some Js: <br>
